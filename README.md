This indicates a strong seasonal performance tied to cultural and personal milestones. The "Category" bar chart further breaks down revenue by product type, with Sweets emerging as the top category, followed by Soft Toys, Parcels, Magnam, and others, underscoring the popularity of gifting consumables and novelty items.

#### Temporal and Product Insights
The "Monthly Data" line graph reveals revenue fluctuations across 2023, with notable peaks in March and July, likely linked to festive or seasonal demand (e.g., Holi in March).
